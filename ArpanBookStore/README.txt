Hi there I am working again using mvc on new application . This time I am building the BookStore website and this is the Assignment 2.
Since there is alot of new things to see , I have the Areas folder Data folder already built in, Niether like the assignment 1 where i created it by my self.

PART 1
The first step he told to do is to edit the startup.cs file. As he mentioned we commented the Identity user in the services.
Now lets runs it if its working or not .............. Its working nothing to be worry about.

I did a interesting step here which I tried in the class also, I tried to register the on my application by email and password.
And when i click submit it pops up with an exception. I was worried but it was nothing just said to update the database. I hit the button apply migrations and it worked. 

PART 2

Lets move forward and try debugging.

I added a breakpoint only on privacy view and tested it while clicking it on the browser. It stops the browser and after i clicked it proceeded the action.

PART 3:

I am working on the Part 3 the Bootstrap.css.
I selected my theme from the bootswatch and downloaded the file bootstrap.css sof the theme.
I changed the nav classes text dark and the footer properties as given in the instructions.Later I change the loginPartial file also I removed the text dark from the nav links.

I did'nt like the bootstrap.css i chose , so i changed it and apply it again... So the one I applied now i liked it..... I'll keep this one ..

According to the provided links I added the given scripted links in my layout.cshtml file.
I added the css links and js links in it.
 In my this steo I added the dropdown menu in the layout page. As given in the instructions i added the cod in the layout.cshtml and it test it out.
 Yes its working......................................

 Now I added a dropdoen list in the layout.cshtml file
 I cahnged the name from dropdown to the Content Management.
 I created the ArpansBooks.DataAccess, ArpansBooks.Models and ArpansBooks.Utility class library as given in the instructions .

 I pasted the data folder in dataaccess and deleted the original one.

 I installed the entity frameworks that were required to install with version 5.0.17.
 The Microsoft.entityframework.relational and the entityframework.sqlserver.
 Next it said to delete the migrations folder and install the indentity.EntityFramework Core with the version 5.0.2 in the project. I followed the step as per instructions.........

 In my next I cjhanged the namespace according to the project and deleted the class1.cs files from every project.
 Next I moved the Models folder into the models project and deleted the original one.

 I renamed the models folder with the ViewModels file and changed the namespace of ErrorViewModel.cs to models.ViewModels as per given instructions.

Modified the dbcontext of the  startup.cs file and fixed all the list of errors thank god .................... I am able to do that... I am so proud of myself..

Finally i solved the errors.

In my utility projects i added the class with the name SD.cs file and modified the properties of the file. Later I added the reference of the utility project with the main project 
and added the dataaccess project refrence to the utility and models project.
